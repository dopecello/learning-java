# Constructors

Constructors make objects. This concept of contructors goes into the philosophy of OOP... If everything in the world is an object, then theoretically, everything in the world can be programmed via a computer using Objects!

Objects have properties that do and are certain things... in this manner, we can apply the same to objects within Java.
